## Introduction

This project is a basic calculator application developed in C++ using the GTK library for creating the graphical user interface. The calculator supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations.

## Features

- Graphical user interface with GTK.
- Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Error handling for division by zero and invalid operations.

## Requirements

- C++ compiler
- GTK library

## Building and Running

To build and run the calculator, follow these steps:

1. Install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   # For Debian/Ubuntu-based systems
   sudo apt-get install g++ libgtk-3-dev
   ```

2. Compile the code:

   ```bash
   g++ -o calculator main.cpp $(pkg-config --cflags --libs gtk+-3.0)
   ```

3. Run the executable:

   ```bash
   ./calculator
   ```

## Usage

- Enter numbers using the numeric buttons.
- Perform arithmetic operations using the corresponding buttons.
- Press the "=" button to calculate the result.
- Error messages will be displayed for division by zero and invalid operations.
